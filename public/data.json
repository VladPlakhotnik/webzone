The first mention of CSS appeared in 1994, when Haakon Vium Lee proposed using the CSS language for stylistic design of web pages. And on December 17, 1996, the first specification (CSS1) was published, and it was recommended for use by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). At the moment, the current version is CSS3, which has greatly advanced in its capabilities when compared with previous versions."

            "answer": "At the dawn of the development of the Internet, developers made do with HTML for the layout of web pages, but at some point its capabilities were clearly not enough for page design tasks. The site owners wanted to create sites with individual, often complex designs in order to attract more users. Before the advent of CSS, pages were designed only inside the same document using HTML. CSS technologies made it possible to separate the content of the document and its visual design. For example, thanks to them, it became easy to apply a single style for each document by simply connecting a CSS file to HTML. Now it was enough to change the value of any disposal property in only one file, and it was applied on all pages where this file was connected."
